OVERVIEW

THE TEAM

We are a team of US Military Veterans who are Full Stack Software Engineers. We all met during a non-profit bootcamp for veterans and military spouses. We recently graduated and came together to work on this project. We were all on different timezone and currently located in the United States, Canada and Switzerland. This made our daily stand ups more challenging. However, our time in our bootcamp gave us a good base to work off of as we were remote during the whole cohort due to COVID. This allowed us to easily work around each persons schedule and stay on track as a team. 

Each person bio can found below:

DESIGN

We started with a wire frame of our over all design to make sure we got a feel for the UX/UI. We made sure we had an overall agreement on it before we moved on to a full mockup. This was used as our initial guide to understand what functionality we wanted and where we needed to improve. As well as where we wanted to depoy everything within the app.

After our intial wireframing was done we moved on to building a full mockup of the App with colors and pictures. This allowed us to get a real look at what the app should look like as we build it out. By doing this it helped us move quickly with how the app would be built out when we started coding.

Front End Tech Stack
In the decision on what tech to use in the front end we decided that we would use what we all have worked with before. We decided to use Javascript with React as our framework. Then we went with Material-UI for prebuilt components. This helped us keep a streamlined look and feel during our built out.
