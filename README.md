OVERVIEW


DESIGN

We started with a wire frame of our over all design to make sure we got a feel for the UX/UI. We made sure we had an overall agreement on it before we moved on to a full mockup.

After our intial wireframing was done we moved on to building a full mockup of the App with colors and pictures. This allowed us to get a real look at what the app should look like as we build it out.
